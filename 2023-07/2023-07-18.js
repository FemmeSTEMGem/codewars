// Your coworker was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize a string (that contains a single word) before they went on vacation.

// Unfortunately, they have now left and the code they gave you doesn't work. Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended (i.e. make the first character in the string "word" upper case).

// Don't worry about numbers, special characters, or non-string types being passed to the function. The string lengths will be from 1 character up to 10 characters, but will never be empty.

function capitalizeWord(word) {
  return word.replace(word[0], word[0].toUpperCase())
}

console.log(capitalizeWord("glasswear"))
// Honestly, among the best solutions. Only other thing I saw that's comparable was using .toUpperCase() combined with .slice()


// The wide-mouth frog is particularly interested in the eating habits of other creatures.

// He just can't stop asking the creatures he encounters what they like to eat. But, then he meets the alligator who just LOVES to eat wide-mouthed frogs!

// When he meets the alligator, it then makes a tiny mouth.

// Your goal in this kata is to create complete the mouth_size method this method takes one argument animal which corresponds to the animal encountered by the frog. If this one is an alligator (case-insensitive) return small otherwise return wide.

function mouthSize(animal) {
  return animal.toLowerCase() == "alligator" ? "small" : "wide"
}

console.log(mouthSize("Alligator"))
// Nice and simple ternary operation.
