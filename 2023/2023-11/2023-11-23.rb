# Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.
# 
# 'world'  =>  'dlrow'
# 'word'   =>  'drow'

def solution(str)
  str.reverse
end

print solution("hello")
# Easy peasy, but I still learned something new! I don't think I knew that I could call a function without attaching "()" to the end. Or maybe I'm just having holdover habits from JavaScript. ^_^
