// Complete the function that calculates the area of the red square, when the length of the circular arc A is given as the input. Return the result rounded to two decimals.
// Note: use the Ï€ value provided in your language (Math::PI, M_PI, math.pi, etc)

// Annoyingly, I wasn't able to find any good resources online for the geometry math, so I ended up having to look at the answers. BUT, I learned some new stuff about .toFixed() that somehow never came up before. I didn't know that it turned numbers into strings and that this can be fixed by adding "+" in front of the number you're .toFixed()'ing to. ^_^


// Messi goal scoring statistics:
// La Liga 	43
// Champions League 	10
// Copa del Rey 	5
// Create these three variables and store the appropriate values using the table above:
// laLigaGoals
// championsLeagueGoals
// copaDelReyGoals
// Create a fourth variable named totalGoals that stores the sum of all of Messi's goals for this year.


let laLigaGoals = 43
let championsLeagueGoals = 10
let copaDelReyGoals = 5
let totalGoals = laLigaGoals + championsLeagueGoals + copaDelReyGoals

// Too easy for this kata level, but if I were doing this for realzies I'd probably store these in an object.
